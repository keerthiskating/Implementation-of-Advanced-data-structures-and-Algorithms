In this project, we developed a program that finds Euler tours in directed graph.

The files that are required are :
Euler.java
LP2.java
CC.java
StronglyConnected.java
Graph.java
Timer.java
ArrayIterator.java


Euler.java - It finds Euler tours and prints the euler tours.
LP2.java - Driver class for Euler
StronglyConnected.java - It calculates the number of strongly connected components in the graph.
Graph.java - It is used to construct a graph.


Execution :
	1) Compile all the .java files
	2) Run the LP2.java and it gives the output .
